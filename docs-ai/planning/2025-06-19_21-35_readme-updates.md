# README.md Updates - 2025-06-19

## Problem Statement
The README.md file had several inaccuracies and missing information that needed to be corrected to reflect the current project state.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect File Reference
**Problem**: Referenced `fastapi-endpoint-example.py` but actual file is `fastapi-endpoint-simplified.py`
**Solution**: Updated file reference to match actual filename

### 2. Incorrect Test Command
**Problem**: Showed `npm test` but package.json uses `npm run test`
**Solution**: Fixed command syntax to match package.json scripts

### 3. Missing Test Commands
**Problem**: Missing `npm run test:coverage` command available in package.json
**Solution**: Added complete test command documentation including coverage

### 4. Incomplete Deployment Information
**Problem**: Deployment section didn't mention custom domain verification
**Solution**: Enhanced CD Pipeline section with:
- Custom domain verification details
- Dual endpoint testing (Cloud Run + custom domain)
- Deployment success criteria
